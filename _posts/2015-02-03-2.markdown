This tutorial assumes you are running Ubuntu 14.04. If you want to install
Ubuntu on your machine, follow [this tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-4 %}).

***NOTE:*** *If you use virtual machine it will cause problems.*

To create a TurtleBot simulation you will need to install ROS Indigo and
TurtleBot packages following [this tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-5 %}).

***NOTE:*** *You should use the LTS versions of these software as we wrote
[before]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-4 %}). Both Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS
Indigo are LTS.*

You can check which version of Linux you have by running:
{% highlight sh %}
lsb_release -a
{% endhighlight %}

You have the right version if you see:
{% highlight sh %}
Description: Ubuntu 14.04.* LTS
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html img="/assets/sim_lsb_release.png" title="Result of “lsb_release -a” in Terminal" %}

You have to set up the ROS environment variables before executing any ROS
command. You have to run in every new terminal:
{% highlight sh %}
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
{% endhighlight %}

But, you can pre-configure your terminal with ROS environment variables and
do not think about it:
{% highlight sh %}
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

***NOTE:*** *If you want to edit or remove this configuration from your terminal's
environment you will need to edit `~/.bashrc` and make the updates there.*

Adding settings to the `~/.bashrc` will affect only new terminals. So you will
need to reopen the terminals.

***NOTE:*** *We use the pre-configured terminal in all lessons, so do not forget
to write the proper command if you prefer the first case.*

You can check which distribution of ROS you have by running:
{% highlight sh %}
roscore
{% endhighlight %}

You have the right distribution if you see:
{% highlight sh %}
 * /rosdistro: indigo
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html img="/assets/sim_roscore.png" title="Result of “roscore” in Terminal" %}

ROS is installed correctly if you see:
{% highlight sh %}
started core service [/rosout]
{% endhighlight %}

If there are any troubles, try to reinstall the software step by step using the
tutorials. In addition, you can ask your questions or find a solution for
similar problem on [this site](http://answers.ros.org/questions/).
