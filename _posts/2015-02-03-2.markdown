***NOTE:*** *Some parts of this article duplicate information from [TurtleBot Simulation]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-28 %}) post. We will merge them later.*

This tutorial assumes you are running Ubuntu 14.04. You can run Ubuntu natively on your own machine or in virtual machine. If you want to install Ubuntu on your machine, follow [this tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-4 %}).

To create a TurtleBot simulation you will need to install ROS Indigo and TurtleBot packages following [this tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-5 %}).

***NOTE:*** *You should use the LTS versions of these software as we wrote [before]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-4 %}). Both Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo are LTS.*

You can check which version of Linux you have by running:

{% highlight sh %}
lsb_release -a
{% endhighlight %}

You have the right version if you see:
{% highlight sh %}
Description: Ubuntu 14.04.* LTS
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html img="/assets/sim_lsb_release.png" title="Results of “lsb_release -a” in Terminal" %}

You have to set up the ROS environment variables before executing any ROS command. You have to run in every new terminal:
{% highlight sh %}
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
{% endhighlight %}

But, you can pre-configure your terminal with ROS environment variables and don’t think about it:
{% highlight sh %}
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

***NOTE:*** *We use the pre-configured terminal in all lessons, so don’t forget to write the proper command if your prefer the first case.*

You can check which distribution of ROS you have by running:
{% highlight sh %}
roscore
{% endhighlight %}

You have the right distribution if you see:
{% highlight sh %}
 * /rosdistro: indigo
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html img="/assets/sim_roscore.png" title="Results of “roscore” in Terminal" %}

ROS is installed correctly if you see:
{% highlight sh %}
started core service [/rosout]
{% endhighlight %}

If there are any troubles, try to reinstall the software step by step using the tutorials. In addition, you can ask your questions or find a solution for similar problem on [this site](http://answers.ros.org/questions/).
