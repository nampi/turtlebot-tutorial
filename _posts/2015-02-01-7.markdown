Now that we’ve chased [TurtleBot around while pressing keys on the netbook]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-6 %}), we can really appreciate the workstation. This allows you to control TurtleBot from the comfort of your chair.

## Synchronizing Clocks (TurtleBot and Workstation)

Follow only the [“Network Time Protocol” instructions on the Post-Installation Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Post-Installation%20Setup) page. Skip the special cases instructions.

***QUICK TIP:** Make sure both TurtleBot and the workstation are connected to the same router. To avoid problems moving forward, disable security options such as firewalls and anything that does port blocking .*

## Set Up Networking (TurtleBot and Workstation)

[Follow the network configuration instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Network%20Configuration) and follow the options for “source installation”. Note that there are different and specific instructions for TurtleBot and the workstation.

## Shell into TurtleBot

{% include critical_pre.html title="Warning" %}
This may affect the security of your TurtleBot computer. Don’t do this outside of a local network or if it contains confidential information.

{% include critical_post.html %}

Though you can always go find the TurtleBot and type in the commands directly, it’s more convenient to SSH into its computer and control it from there.

Check if SSH service exists by running on TurtleBot:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo service ssh status
{% endhighlight %}

If you receive `ssh: unrecognized service`, install the SSH server via:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
{% endhighlight %}

Now that you’ve confirmed you have SSH installed or have just installed it, run:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
{% endhighlight %}

Find TurtleBot’s IP by running the following on TurtleBot’s computer:

{% highlight sh %}
ifconfig
{% endhighlight %}

After `wlan0` (not "lo") you’ll see an `inet addr:`. That is TurtleBot’s IP.

***TIP:** If it starts with 127, it’s probable the IP for `lo` is the wrong one.*

On the workstation, open a terminal and run:

{% highlight sh %}
ssh turtlebot@[ip_of_turtlebot]
{% endhighlight %}

NOTE: Replace `[ip_of_turtlebot]` with TurtleBot’s IP and `turtlebot` with its username if you chose a name different from “turtlebot”.

Now you can SSH into TurtleBot to run scripts including the start-up script:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
{% endhighlight %}

…without having to walk over to TurtleBot!

***TIP:** The password is the same password you use to log in to the TurtleBot computer (default: `turtlebot`).*

## Drive in Comfort

On the TurtleBot computer, close all terminal windows, close the computer, and set it on the [second shelf like we did in the Hardware Setup tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-3 %}). Now that you know how to SSH into TurtleBot via your workstation you can run anything you need via the workstation.

Run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
{% endhighlight %}

***NOTE:** `turtlebot_bringup` is the way of “booting up” TurtleBot. This must be run remotely on TurtleBot, never directly on the workstation.*

On the workstation, run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
{% endhighlight %}

Try driving around from the workstation. This is what you should see on the workstation’s screen:

And this is what you should see in your office, home, etc:
