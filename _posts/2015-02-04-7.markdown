In this lesson we will launch TurtleBot follower demo. We will launch two
TurtleBots in Gazebo Concert, then you will drive the first TurtleBot and the
second will follow it.

## Prerequisites

1\. This lesson is a continuation of the previous lesson:
["Multiple TurtleBots in Concert"]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-04-6 %}).
If you have not done instructions from `prerequisites` section, you should do
them firstly.

[comment]: <> (TODO: remove `make` instruction when launch file for simulation will be in deb package)

2\. Make turtlebot_follower.
{% highlight sh %}
cd ~/helloworld/turtlebot/my_turtlebot_follower
catkin_make
{% endhighlight %}

## Launch Script

1\. Launch Gazebo Concert (steps 1-11 from the previous lesson).

[comment]: <> (TODO: remove `change the path` instruction when launch file for simulation will be in deb package)

2\. Open a new terminal and change the path to the turtlebot_follower package.
{% highlight sh %}
source /home/<your_name>/helloworld/turtlebot/my_turtlebot_follower/devel/setup.bash
{% endhighlight %}

3\. Launch turtlebot_follower demo.
{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_follower follower.launch simulation:=true __ns:=gamza2
{% endhighlight %}

***NOTE:*** *__ns is a substitute for ROS_NAMESPACE.*

4\. Drive `gamza1` using joystick. You will see the reaction of `gamza2`.

***NOTE:*** *If `gamza1` is very close to `gamza2`, then `gamza2` will go back.*

5\. Interrupt the processes. Close the windows.
