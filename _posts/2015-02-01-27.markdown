[We need your help]({{ site.url }}/about/)! Though the netbook and Kobuki batteries will autonomously charge and could theoretically run indefinitely, the Keurig is *not* powered by the base. In our demo the customer must plug in the Keurig to use it. Powering the Keurig plus a few other features would make our demo a full-fledged CoffeeBot!

- **Power the Keurig:** Due to Keurigâ€™s 1000-1500 watt requirements, the customer must plug in the Keurig when it arrives at their desk. Finding a way to power it via a separate battery charged by the docking station would be a fantastic update.
- **Automatic Water Refills:** A 3D printed top for TurtleBot that would allow the Keurig to refill its water reservoir automatically would be awesome.
- **Water Level Monitoring:** While one could estimate water usage based on the number of stops, a water level sensor would be ideal.
