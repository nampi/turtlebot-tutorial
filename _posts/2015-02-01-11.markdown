Though ROS can work in unknown environments, it helps to start with a map of the environment that we’re working in.

In this tutorial we’ll drive TurtleBot once around our office using teleoperation to create a map. This will give us a map we can reference in other scripts, giving TurtleBot completely autonomous navigation.

## Create a Map Via Teleoperation

On TurtleBot, open a terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch
{% endhighlight %}

On the workstation, open a terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
{% endhighlight %}

***TIP:** Instead of using the keyboard, the joystick may be more convenient.*

Now using teleoperation, navigate TurtleBot around the entire area you wish to map.

On TurtleBot, open a terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map
ls /tmp/
{% endhighlight %}

You will now see two files in the `/tmp/ directory my_map.pgm` and `my_map.yaml`. As you create maps in the future, you can save them with different names (e.g. `/tmp/my_office`).

***TIP:** Ubuntu's `/tmp/` directory is automatically cleaned (deleted) on every boot. You may want to use a different directory if you need want to keep the maps.*
