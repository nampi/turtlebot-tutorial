We have learnt how to take a photo manually, but it is not very convenient.
In this lesson we will learn how to take a photo using a script.

We will work with the files from the [github repository](https://github.com/markwsilliman/turtlebot/)
again. If you havenâ€™t done [this lesson]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-03-7 %})
please do it firstly. We assume that your files are situated here `~/helloworld/turtlebot`.

## Launch Script

1\. Launch gazebo.
{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
{% endhighlight %}

1\. Open a new terminal and change directory.
{% highlight sh %}
cd ~/helloworld/turtlebot
{% endhighlight %}

2\. Launch script.
{% highlight sh %}
python take_photo.py
{% endhighlight %}

3\. See the results. Open the image file.
{% highlight sh %}
ristretto photo.jpg
{% endhighlight %}

***NOTE:*** *You can use image viewer which you prefer.*

4\. Interrupt gazebo. Close the terminals.

You can watch these steps in the video:
