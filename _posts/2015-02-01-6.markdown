***NOTE:** For this tutorial, set the computer on top of TurtleBot with the lid open instead of placing the closed netbook on the shelf above the Kobuki base.*

## Test ROS Installation (TurtleBot and Work Station)

Close all open terminals, and let’s test our ROS installation by opening a new terminal window (ctrl + alt + t) and running:

{% highlight sh %}
roscore
{% endhighlight %}

ROS is installed correctly if you see:

{% highlight sh %}
started core service [/rosout]
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html img="/assets/roscore-2.png" title="“roscore” Running, “started core service [/rosout]” Shows Us ROS is Installed Correctly" %}

If you see this, close this window.

If you don’t see *started core service [/rosout]*, there is a problem with your installation. [Check this page for solutions](http://answers.ros.org/questions/).

## Move Forward Via Teleoperation (TurtleBot only)

Make sure TurtleBot’s Kobuki base is turned on (on/off switch is on the side).

{% include image.html img="/assets/kobuki-onoff.jpg" title="Kobuki Base On/Off Switch, Turned “On”" %}

The Kobuki base status light will turn green if you have sufficient battery power.

{% include image.html img="/assets/kobuki-status-light.jpg" title="Kobuki Base Showing that We Have Sufficient Battery Power" %}

Close any open terminals, then open a new terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch 
{% endhighlight %}

{% include youtube.html youtubeid="ZAnfkpanUA0" youtubetitle="turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch"%}

TurtleBot will chime, letting you know that it’s booting up.

When we were testing we saw a large number of warnings:

{% highlight sh %}
"Rapp Manager: No preferred rapp for  'rocon apps/talker'" warnings. 
{% endhighlight %}

They aren’t pretty, but they don’t affect the performance of these tutorials.

Open another terminal tab and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
{% endhighlight %}

{% include youtube.html youtubeid="a71oSx9HNY0" youtubetitle="turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch"%}

After this script has completely launched, instructions for controlling TurtleBot will be printed to the window. Press “i” to move forward.

{% include youtube.html youtubeid="_jsd5xDYvmg" youtubetitle="TurtleBot Teleop Example"%}

***NOTE:** This terminal window must be in focus/active (as opposed to another terminal window or program) for these commands to work.*
